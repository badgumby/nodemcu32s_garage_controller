# NodeMCU-32s Garage Controller

This project is still a WIP, so the code is yet to be optimized. The goal is to turn my two regular garage doors into "smart" garage doors. This controller will be the base platform using a NodeMCU-32s (or similarly cloned SoC).
  
## Sensors/Devices Attached
 
There are multiple things connected to this control board, with more to be added in the future. 
  
- Two magnetic reed switches
  - Similar item on Amazon: [Gikfun MC-38 Wired Door Sensor Magnetic Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0154PTDFI?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details)

- Two 3mm green LEDs pre-soldered 460 ohm resistors
  - Similar item, but white, on Amazon: [KeeYees 60Pcs 3mm Pre Wired LED](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Diodes-Plastic-Mounting-Holders/dp/B07M9YT8C8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1WI4HWRRCNXY3&keywords=3mm+5v+led&qid=1645209466&s=industrial&sprefix=3mm+5v+led%2Cindustrial%2C95&sr=1-3)

- One 2-channel 5VDC relay module

## Additional Materials

These are other things that I will be using in this project.

- Speaker wire
  - Run from the relay to the garage door button sockets.

- Printed circuit board
  - Just a generic PCB large enough to accommodate solder points for LEDs, relay leads, etc.

- 3D printer filament
  - I will be 3D printing an enclosure for this and will add it to the project once complete.
